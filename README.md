# Power_Flow_Octave
Octave (Matlab) implementation for the Power Flow solution using Newton-Raphson Method

The algorithm uses the newton raphson method to obtain the states of the system and also the power injection and flows using the Jacobian matrix (partial derivates of V and Theta). The program has two menus, one to choose the power system to analyze, and another one to show the solutions.
