# Power_Flow_Octave
Octave (Matlab) implementation for the Power Flow solution using Newton-Raphson Method

Theses functions will use the newton-raphson method to obtain the states of the shoosen power system and also the power injection and flows using the Jacobian matrix (partial derivates of V and Theta).
